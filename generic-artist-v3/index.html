          <p>
            Whenever I go on planes, I like to give myself coding challenges to try and complete on the plane
            before the plane lands or my laptop dies, whichever happens first. In late October of 2017, I got
            the chance to fly from California to the East Coast, and for that flight, I decided to try programming
            a virtual version of Leonardo Da Vinci.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, though, it seemed really difficult to program an artificial intelligence, so I thought
            instead of programming a single good painter, I can program a ton of paintings at random and select
            the best of them to make more!
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, I wanted to builld a <b>Genetic Algorithm</b>.

        <div class="slide-title">The Theory</div>
        <div class="slide-body">
          <p>
            In essense, Genetic Algorithms need a few basic components to work. A
            genetic algorithm attempts to get better at doing some task or get closer
            to some goal by sort of mimicking the process of evolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's begin with the idea of actual evolution. It's been commonly accepted
            that evolution takes place over generations, where two organisms, like say
            two fish reproduce. Their baby fish will have half the DNA of each parent,
            and also some random mutations to allow for small adaptations, so that over
            millions of years, adaptations that are beneficial and improve the fish's
            fitness in its environment will get spread across the population.
          </p>
          <p>
            The genetic algorithm breaks down this theory and uses the basic components
            to generate approximate solutions for achieving of a goal. Basically, you
            need to have:
            <ol>
              <li> <b>"Organisms"</b> that breed and carry the "genetics" </li>
              <li> <b>"DNA"</b> that get's passed from parent to child</li>
              <li> <b>"Population"</b> which is basically a ton of organisms at once. </li>
              <li> <b>"Breeding"</b> that takes half the DNA from each "parent" with some random mutations </li>
              <li> <b>"Fitness"</b> which is a measure of how well the organism does at the task </li>
            </ol>
            The task then becomes, to make a painter, what do I map to each of these five basic features.

        <div class="slide-title">The Application</div>
        <div class="slide-body">
          <p>
            For my case, the organisms are objects that hold the DNA, which I will call "painters", are
            in charge of breeding, and get evaluated on their fitness for how well suited they are for the
            task at hand. This task, I remind you, is to draw a a given picture with random shapes and colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, the DNA that each painter has will just be a huge list of shapes. Each shape keeps track of its vertices and
            its color. The DNA is basically the recipe for how to build the picture that the painter can
            paint. For our purposes, each painter can only paint on painting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The population is basically just a big list of painters to choose from.
          </p>
          <p>
            The breeding will go through the DNA for each parent and randomly select one shape from each
            parent in order with equal probability. Then each shape will have some small chance of "mutating"
            or basically just changing slightly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we have a fitness function. This basically draws the picture
